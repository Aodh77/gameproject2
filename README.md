Games engines 2 assignment 

## Description 
this project is space simulation inspired by the tv show the expanse it features to ships one which foolows a that is set and the other ship follows the first ship 

## Development
the project was created by reworking the code for the steering behavious done in class to have a ship follow a preset path and for the other ship to update the location of its target these scipts were also used to have the chasing ships rockets work and to get the gun turret on the main ship to rotate and follow targets 

the camera has a script so that it follows the main ship that I got from a toutotial here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFQhpwc6cKE
I had plans to do multiple cameras but the sound kept messing up and I ran out of time
